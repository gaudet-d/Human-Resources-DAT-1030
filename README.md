## General Info
This project is a simple analysis of human resources data to assess why the best and most experienced employees are leaving prematurely. This analysis focuses primarily on attrition and the monthly income of salespeople. 

The Human Resource Analysis data can be accessed from the Kaggle website at: https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset.

## Results
The results of this analysis indicate that the majority of the salespeople do not have attrition. Further, the result indicate that the monthly income of employees with attrition against those without seems very similar, however, the monthly income of salespeople with attrition does seem to have some rightward skew. This may indicate that those with attrition may have lower monthly incomes.
